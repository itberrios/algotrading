        "According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp): \"The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) also states that: \"Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. \"\n",
        "\n",
        "Both the RSI and MACD are [momentum indicators](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/momentum-and-relative-strength-index/) which means that they measure the rate of rise and fall of prices."
